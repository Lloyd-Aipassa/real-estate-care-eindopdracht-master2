                                    Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the
                                    Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark
                                    was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great
                                    wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful
                                    men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years
                                    until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of
                                    Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used
                                    to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use
                                    against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Following his
                                    fight against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man.<br><br>
                                    After leaving his superhero life behind him, he is now a well respected inspecter for Real Estate Care
